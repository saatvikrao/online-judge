this is an attempt at making an online judge for iit gandhinagar's flagship hackathon "hackrush"

tech stack:<br>
frontend: reactjs <br> 
backend: node <br>
database: mongodb <br>


todo: 
- print the shell output on the main frontend screen beside the code editor
- make this beautiful
- make the problem statement(ability to add a problem statement as a markdown file) and doubts pages (have people ask doubt and people can comment here)
